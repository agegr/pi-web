# Pi Web

[中文文档](./README.zh-CN.md) | [日本語](./README.ja.md) | [Русский](./README.ru.md)

Local browser UI for the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Pi Web uses the same local configuration and session files as pi, so you can browse and resume conversations, run agent turns, configure models and resources, and inspect project files from a browser.

## Features

- **Session workspace**: browse, resume, rename, export, and delete conversations grouped by project, with running state, context usage, cost, and compaction details.
- **Two ways to branch**: **New session** creates an independent session file from an earlier message; **Edit from here** creates a branch inside the current session.
- **Project file tools**: browse and upload files, inspect Git diffs, and preview source, Markdown, images, audio, PDFs, and DOCX files with automatic refresh.
- **Git worktrees**: switch checkouts from the sidebar while keeping sessions from the same repository grouped together.
- **Web-based configuration**: manage provider login and API keys, models, model tests, plugin packages, and skills without leaving Pi Web.
- **English and Simplified Chinese UI**: Pi Web follows the browser language initially and provides a language switcher in the top bar.

## Quick Start

Pi Web requires Node.js 22.19.0 or newer. Check your version with `node --version`, then run:

```bash
npx @agegr/pi-web@latest
```

The CLI opens a browser after the server is ready. If it does not, open [http://127.0.0.1:30141](http://127.0.0.1:30141). Pi Web listens only on `127.0.0.1` by default.

If no model provider is configured yet, open the **Models** panel to sign in or add an API key.

To install the `pi-web` command globally:

```bash
npm install -g @agegr/pi-web@latest
pi-web
```

To update, stop the running process with `Ctrl+C` and run the same install command again. To uninstall, run `npm uninstall -g @agegr/pi-web`.

## Configuration

For port and hostname, command-line options override the corresponding environment variables. Either `--no-open` or `PI_WEB_NO_OPEN=1` disables automatic browser opening.

| Option or environment variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--port <port>`, `-p <port>`, or `PORT` | Server port | `30141` |
| `--hostname <host>`, `-H <host>`, or `PI_WEB_HOSTNAME` | Bind hostname (e.g. `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, or your Tailscale IP) | `127.0.0.1` |
| `--no-open` or `PI_WEB_NO_OPEN=1` | Do not open a browser automatically | Browser opens |
| `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Additional exact proxy or custom hostnames, comma-separated | Unset |
| `PI_WEB_PASSWORD` | Pin the Basic Auth password (the username is always `pi`). When unset, the server auto-generates a 6-digit PIN on first network request and writes it to `~/.pi-web/` so it survives restarts. | Auto-generated 6-digit PIN |

For example:

```bash
pi-web -p 8080 -H 0.0.0.0 --no-open
```

### Remote Access

Binding to a non-loopback address exposes an agent that can execute high-privilege actions. Pi Web's Basic Auth does not encrypt the password in transit, so do not expose the server over plain HTTP to the internet; use HTTPS through a trusted reverse proxy or a trusted VPN. If a reverse proxy sends an external hostname, add that exact name to `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. This allow-list does not change the address Pi Web binds to.

By default, no password is configured. The first time a network request reaches Pi Web it auto-generates a 6-digit PIN and writes it to the runtime store (so it survives restarts). Open the **Connect Phone** icon in the top bar to see the current PIN; the QR code there also encodes a one-time pairing token so the phone lands already authenticated.

To pin your own password instead of the auto-generated one, set `PI_WEB_PASSWORD` in the environment:

```bash
PI_WEB_PASSWORD='your-password-here' pi-web --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

### Mobile Access

`http://127.0.0.1:30141` only works on the computer running Pi Web — on a phone, `127.0.0.1` means the phone itself. Use the computer's real address instead:

**Same Wi-Fi.** Bind to all interfaces and open `http://<computer-LAN-IP>:30141` on the phone:

```bash
pi-web --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

The QR code in the top-bar **Connect Phone** modal encodes the address and a one-time pairing token, so the phone lands on the desktop session directly without typing a password.

**Any network, via Tailscale.** Install Tailscale on both machines and join them to the same tailnet. Bind Pi Web to the tailnet address (find yours with `tailscale ip -4`):

```bash
pi-web --hostname 100.x.x.x
```

The launcher resolves the Tailscale IP automatically — when `-H 0.0.0.0` is used, the QR encodes the Tailscale IP so the phone can dial it. Tailscale clients: [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tailscale/id1470499037) · [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tailscale.ipn). To share with someone else, invite them to the same tailnet and give them the address.

**Authentication on the phone.** The phone is prompted for the 6-digit PIN only if it lands via the URL directly without the pairing token. The QR code path bypasses this — the pairing token is exchanged for a 30-day session cookie on first scan. The cookie persists across server restarts (because it is keyed off a server secret stored in `~/.pi-web/session.key`) but is invalidated whenever the server's `PI_WEB_PASSWORD` value changes.

### HTTP Proxy

Server-side model and API requests honor the standard `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables.

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 \
npx @agegr/pi-web@latest
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:HTTP_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:NO_PROXY = "localhost,127.0.0.1"
npx @agegr/pi-web@latest
```

## Notes

- **Agent data**: Pi Web reads pi data from `~/.pi/agent` by default, including session files under `sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`. Set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to use another pi agent directory.
- **Filesystem access**: Pi Web must be able to read the agent data directory and the working directories recorded by its sessions. Run Pi Web in the same filesystem environment as pi when sharing existing sessions.
- **Shared configuration**: the Models panel uses pi's model, settings, and credential storage, so changes are visible to both interfaces.
- **File access boundary**: the file browser is limited to working directories selected in Pi Web and project or session roots it already knows about; it is not a general filesystem browser.
- **Git worktrees**: see [Worktrees in Pi Web](./docs/worktrees.md) for switcher visibility, worktree creation, and removal behavior.

### Downstream Session Context Menu

Electron wrappers and other downstream integrations can provide a session-row
context menu without patching `SessionSidebar`. Listen for the cancelable
`pi-web:session-row-contextmenu` browser event and call `preventDefault()`
synchronously when the integration will handle it:

```js
window.addEventListener("pi-web:session-row-contextmenu", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const { id, path, cwd, name, clientX, clientY, refresh } = event.detail;

  void openSessionMenu({ id, path, cwd, name, clientX, clientY }).then((changed) => {
    if (changed) refresh();
  });
});
```

The detail object contains `id`, `path`, `cwd`, optional `name`, pointer
coordinates, and a `refresh()` callback for actions that change the session
list. If no listener cancels the extension event, Pi Web preserves the
browser's native context menu. This hook is browser-side and independent of
Pi agent extensions.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs at [http://127.0.0.1:30141](http://127.0.0.1:30141). Run the common checks with:

```bash
npm test
node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
```

Do not run `next build` or `npm run build` during normal development. It writes to `.next/` and can interfere with the development server; leave builds for release work.
