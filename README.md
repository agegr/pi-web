# Pi Web

[中文文档](./README.zh-CN.md)

Local web UI for the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). Pi Web reads your local pi session files and gives you a browser workspace for session browsing, real-time chat, model configuration, skill management, and project file preview.

![Pi Web shows the same pi session with structured Markdown, tool calls, and project navigation beside the CLI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agegr/pi-web/main/docs/screenshot2.png)

The same pi session in CLI and Pi Web: structured tool calls, readable Markdown, session browsing, and cleaner results.

## Quick Start

**Run without installing:**

```bash
npx @agegr/pi-web@latest
```

**Or install globally:**

```bash
npm install -g @agegr/pi-web
pi-web
```

Then open [http://localhost:30141](http://localhost:30141). The CLI will try to open the browser automatically after the server is ready.

**Options:**

```bash
pi-web --port 8080              # custom port
pi-web --hostname 127.0.0.1     # local access only
pi-web -p 8080 -H 127.0.0.1     # combine options
pi-web --no-open                # do not open the browser automatically

PORT=8080 pi-web                # environment variable is also supported
PI_WEB_NO_OPEN=1 pi-web         # useful when running as a background service
```

## Features

- **Pick work back up**: browse previous pi conversations by project without digging through terminal history or session paths.
- **Try different directions safely**: continue from an earlier message or fork a session into a separate route.
- **Work across branches**: switch Git worktrees from the sidebar so new sessions and the Explorer follow the checkout you choose.
- **Chat beside the project**: browse files on the left and preview source, docs, images, audio, and PDFs on the right while the agent works.
- **See session state clearly**: context usage, cost, compaction state, and system prompt details are visible from the top bar.
- **Configure less from the terminal**: manage models, login/API keys, model tests, and skill switches from the web UI.

## Notes

- **Data directory**: Pi Web reads `~/.pi/agent/sessions` by default. Set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to point at another pi agent directory.
- **Session files**: files are stored as `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`.
- **Model config**: the Models panel reads and writes `models.json` in the pi agent directory. Model lists and defaults come from pi's config.
- **File access**: file browsing and preview are scoped to the selected project directory and working directories that appear in sessions.
- **Git worktrees**: see [Worktrees in Pi Web](./docs/worktrees.md) for when the switcher appears, how new worktrees are created, and what removal does.
- **Forks vs in-session branches**: Fork creates a new `.jsonl` file. "Edit from here" creates another branch inside the same session file.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The local dev server runs at [http://localhost:30141](http://localhost:30141).

Common checks:

```bash
node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
```

Avoid running `next build` / `npm run build` during local development. It writes to `.next/` and can interfere with the dev server; leave builds for release work.

## Desktop packaging

Pi Web can also be packaged as an optional Electron desktop app:

```bash
npm install
npm run desktop:dist
```

The Windows artifact is written to `dist-desktop/`. The desktop wrapper starts the existing Next.js server locally and opens it in an Electron window; the web/CLI runtime is unchanged.

Desktop data directory behavior:

- By default, desktop builds use an app-controlled pi agent directory under Electron `userData` (`<userData>/agent`) instead of `~/.pi/agent`.
- Pass `--agent-dir <path>` to use a specific pi agent directory.
- Pass `--portable` to store data beside the executable under `data/agent`.

Windows desktop builds may include `vendor/mini-bash`. When present, the launcher prepends `vendor/mini-bash/usr/bin` to the server PATH and initializes the desktop agent `settings.json` `shellPath` to the bundled `bash.exe` if no valid shell path exists. This makes the bash tool work without requiring Git Bash, but Git/worktree operations still require Git on PATH, and skill installation/search may still require Node.js/npm/npx.
